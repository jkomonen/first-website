         The Chevrolet Corvette also known as the Vette, is a two-door, two-passenger sports car manufactured and marketed by Chevrolet. Till 2019 it was front-engined, and since 2021 it was mid-engined. The Corvette serves as Chevrolet's halo vehicle and is widely noted for its performance and distinctive plastic—either fiberglass or composite—bodywork. In 1953, when GM executives were looking to name the new Chevrolet sports car it was suggested the name after the small maneuverable warship. The first model was introduced at the GM Motorama in 1953 as a concept. It was followed ten years later by the 1963 second generation, in coupe and convertible styles. The Corvette has been manufactured in Bowling Green, Kentucky since 1981. The Corvette is also called "America's Sports Car" which is why we had to include it in our selection. Automotive News said that the Corvette was in the show Route 66, the Corvette became synonymous with freedom and adventure," ultimately becoming both "the most successful concept car in history and the most popular sports car in history." For only $95, this car is yours for the day and you're guaranteed to pick up any partner you want.

         The Nissan GT-R is a high-performance sports car and grand tourer produced by Nissan in 2007. It is the successor to the Skyline GT-R, a high performance variant of the Nissan Skyline. Although the car is the 6th-generation model, the model is no longer part of the Nissan Skyline model lineup since that name is now reserved for Nissan's luxury-sport vehicles. The GT-R shares the Nissan FM platform with the now separate Nissan Skyline luxury car and the Nissan Z-car sports car. This car is either the most popular choice or one of the most amongst our customers because of its amazing look and amazing price. This specific car has a 98% girl pick up rate meaning that 98% of the time, the driver will pick up a girl. The production version of the GT-R debuted at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show as the 2009 model year. It has a lap time of 7:38 minutes at the Nürburgring Nordschleife beating the all-time sports classic Porsche 911 Turbo as Nissan stated before launching the car. This is also another one of the reasons why this car is such a popular pick.

      <h4 id="4">2014 Lamborghini Gallardo</h4>

         The Lamborghini Gallardo is a sports car built by the Italian automotive manufacturer Lamborghini from 2003 to 2013. It is Lamborghini's best-selling model with 14,022 built throughout its production run. It was named after a very popular fighting bull. The V10 powered Gallardo has been Lamborghini's sales leader and stable-mate to a succession of V12 flagship models—first to the Murciélago, then to the current flagship, the Aventador. In 2013, the last Gallardo was rolled off the production line. The Gallardo was replaced by the Huracán in 2014. The first generation of the Gallardo was powered with an even firing 4,993 cc 90 degree V10 engine generating a maximum power output of 500 PS at 7500 rpm and 510 N⋅m of torque at 4500 RPM. The Gallardo was offered with two choices of transmission. The conventional six-speed manual transmission, and a six-speed electro-hydraulically actuated single-clutch automated manual transmission that Lamborghini called E-gear. It provides gear changes more quickly than could be achieved through a manual shift. The driver shifts up and down via paddles behind the steering wheel, but can also change to an automatic mode via the gear selector located in place of the gear shift lever. The vehicle was designed by Luc Donckerwolke who is a Belgian automotive designer and chief creative officer at Genesis. The car is so prestigious that it was gifted to very prestigious people and organizations. In 2004, two Gallardos were donated to the Italian Polizia di Stato in honor of the force's 152nd anniversary. Another car was donated by Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. while a second one was donated by an independent organization.

      <p>
         The banana car is the most expensive car out of the rest which is why we had to put the hefty price tag of $350. We don't like pricing our cars this high because our mission is to provide the nicest cars at the cheapest prices. But this car costs over $1,000,000 which is why we have to price it higher than the others. The speeds of this car go up to 800mph and is not allowed in Formula One because of the great advantage it puts the driver in. There are no other banana cars in the world because I created this car on my own with the most advanced technologies. I have received offers of $50,000,000 not for the car but for hints of the strategies I used to make it so fast. The speed is not the only thing that makes it so popular. The aesthetic is unique and was rated the most beautiful car of 2021 by Forbes Magazine. The design was based off a banana which is why it is named the banana car. The tyres are the highest quality so you can hit the dirtiest doughnuts in the parking lot. This is by far the best car but not top seller because of its price.
