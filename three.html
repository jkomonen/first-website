      <h2 id="1">Reviews From Over 50 Years of Service</h2>
      <p>
         User experience is our number one priority which is why we take these reviews very seriously. Due to our incredible service and great rates for over 50 years, we have accumulated the best reviews for any company in the world. Out of 5 stars, we received 6. Nobody thought this was possible and it wasn't until we were rated. Our reviews were all 5 stars and the comments were so positive that a new star had to be added to show the quality of our service. Everybody that leaves a review no matter what the rank receives a 50% off coupon for a car and house bundle package. If you leave a review, you can receive the same thing but you must make an account first. We will actually give you our whole company if you leave a bad review. We are that confident that nobody will leave a poor review.

         I was so lonely and played board games all day by myself. I had no car, no house and no friends. I heard about Temporary Luxury from watching CNN because they were saying how great this company is and everybody should try it once. I only had $95 in my pocket and I thought no way could I rent a car and a house just like they were talking about. I went through the site and was so surprised to find the most beautiful cars and homes for prices ranging from $20-$500. I rented a Bugatti Veyron for a day and the house in Las Vegas that it came in the bundle package with for only $55. Now I had these luxuries and enough money to take a girl out for a date. I drove around for one minute and my soon to be girlfriend as you can see in the image with her and I stopped me. She said she loved the car and I told her I can take her on a date to which I did. I took her home after and she was even more impressed when she saw the multi million dollar home. We now have 8 children, 3 dogs, and millions of dollars. My confidence was boosted so much from then on, I began my own company through years of perseverance and now own the world's largest light bulb manufacturer. From rags to riches all through Temporary Luxury. It completely flipped my life around and it can to yours too so you should try. 5 stars!!!

         I was once the top guitarist in the world. Now I am the best guitarist all because of Temporary Luxury. I had a really bad guitar for years which was holding me back and very low self esteem. My friend recommended to try this company so I did and boy do I not regret it at all. I rented a guitar in the shape of a car which I did not think existed only for $40 and a house in the shape of a guitar for $15. When I was driving around Tokyo, an attractive woman stopped me because of the uniqueness of my car. This was the beginning to an amazing relationship that would change my life. I was broke but even after renting a car and house, I could still afford a dinner date. I am so nervous around people but my confidence was boosted to the moon ever since driving the car because it was so amazing to me. I was able to talk to her without being shy like I always am. I took her back to my guitar house and she loved it so she proposed to me on the spot because she didn't want to lose me. I agreed and we called up Temporary Luxury and they sent down a complimentary marriage package so we got married in the living room. I wanted to show her my guitar skills so I found a guitar on the wall and took it out of its glass box. When I made the first strum, my ears were astounded. I realized that this was the best guitar in the world and it was only available in this house. The company allowed me to keep the guitar which is why I rate them 5 stars.

         I was 84 years old and had no husband. My family told me it was too late and they lost all hope for me. I was losing faith too but there had to be something I could do. I found out about Temporary Luxury at my Tuesday backgammon class in Michigan so I knew I had to tke this opportunity. When I saw the prices online, I literally had a heart attack. I was in a coma for 19 years but when I came out, I rented a Lamborghini that hit speeds unknown to humans. When I was driving by an elementary school, I zoomed 600 km/h past them and it caught the eye of a beautiful 102 year old man. He asked if he could hop in and I let him then I went to the max speed. The speedometer broke because it was hitting speeds faster than it was supposed to go and we broke the time barrier. We travelled back 80 years when we were in our 20s. I am still in the 1940's and World War II is currently going on. Because I am German and I still have the technology and knowledge from current time in this time, I gave so much information such as automatic guns, tanks, planes etc. I changed history and Germany won the war and currently rule the whole earth. The German government say "in the foreseeable future we will have flying cars by 1953" all because of me and Temporary Luxury. If I could rate a service over 5 stars I would because this is the best decision I've ever made in my life by doing this.
