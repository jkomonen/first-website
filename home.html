      <h2 id="2">How We Started</h2>
      <p>
         When I was in high school there was this really cute girl I really liked. She wasn't really into me so I had to impress her but I had nothing to impress her with. We planned a date and I picked her up in my rusted 2000 Toyota Land Cruiser. When she saw my car, she threatened to go home which made me so sad. But, she stuck around and we went on a walk around the park because I couldn't afford to take her out to eat. After the date, I drove to my apartment to hang out with her and she almost threw up because of the stench coming from it. It was a terrible house because I just moved out of my parents' home and didn't have much money. At the end of the night, she stopped talking to me and blocked me on all socials. This was all because of my terrible car and house and I hated the feeling. I realized that many men go through the exact same thing as me and I didn't want them to experience it either. A couple of buddies and myself did some brainstorming and thought of the idea to rent cars and houses. These wouldn't be lame but be the most expensive and nicest in order to impress your partner. If I tried to use a service like this when I was in high school, there would be absolutely no way to afford it which is why I made the cheapest prices. Some examples include Lamborghinis for $80 for the day or beachside houses for $50 a day. I bought some cars and houses initially and let my friends use them for free to test the waters and it worked magic. They are all happily married with the partners they went on the dates with because of how impressed they were. I personally am not married because I could not imagine only sticking with one spouse when I can get any partner I want very easily with this service. I have taken over 1,500 partners out in the last 6 months and that's not including the work vacation I took for a month to Dubai. Although we are currently only in North America, we have already made plans to expand to Europe, Africa, Asia and Antarctica. This is not for profit but to ensure nobody suffers what I suffered on my first date in high school.

      <h2 id="3">Why Choose Us?</h2>
      <p>
         There are a handful of reasons to pick us over any other company. First of all, we are rated #1 in the world for the best car and house renting services. 84% of our users and happier and in relationships all from one session with us. One session is all it takes, which is different from our competition which takes an average of 5 or 6. We accomplished this by finishing the absolute best houses and cars for our customers in order to provide them with the best experience. Our competitors buy random products without considering what their users like which is why all prior users of them end up coming to us. Not only do they come to us because of bad experiences with competition but because of our big names. We are all over the news for the connections we have made with celebrities such as Justin Bieber, Kanye West, and even Jennifer Lawrence. You would think that these people would already have enough money to buy cars and houses but they "love our selection that they can't find anywhere else" because we get exclusive products that have not even been released yet. This isn't the only upside to our company because we have the best prices. Competitions offer cars for ridiculous prices such as Maseratis for $1500 an hour when we offer an even newer car for $110 a day. Not only that, but we have a customer loyalty program that makes the cost even cheaper. When you are with us over a certain amount of years or make enough purchases, you get put in the higher class category. You will have 40% off every purchase and have a greater selection to choose from. You will have access to houses unknown to civilization that are very secret, unreleased cars, the fastest cars in the world etc. Also, we have car and house bundles which nobody else has. We find our customers often buy both a house and a car for the night because that is what you need to impress your partner. So, we found the best combinations such as a Nissan GTR and a waterfront house which fit perfectly together and come at a cheaper price. When you buy a bundle, it is 20% cheaper than buying each individually. Lastly, we put all our focus on user experience. Our loyal users are what keeps us running so we put our heart and soul into making your experience the best it can possibly be. This includes free foot massages, complimentary front row sports and concert tickets to anywhere, or free flights to anywhere you would like. According to BBC, The New York Times, Google and many more successful companies, we are "the best in the business" and are a "must use" company.
